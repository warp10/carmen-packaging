Code in src/base/x34000_base is a modification of the DRobot daemon for
the XR4000 Robot released by David Austin under the GNU General Public License
(see above). His code in turn, was based on code now released by Nomadic
Technologies under the GPL as well. This code was released with the following
copyright statement:

The original module was reverse engineered by David Austin

Further modifications to the module were made by me, Mike Montemerlo
(mmde@cs.cmu.edu).
